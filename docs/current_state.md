# Current State

**Phase:** P1 – C++ core (in progress)
**Completed:**
- Workspace directory initialization.
- Top-level CMake + Ninja build (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror`, C++20,
  release defaults `-O3 -march=native`).
- GoogleTest integrated via `FetchContent` (system libstdc++ compatible).
- **Slab allocator** (`cpp/core/slab_allocator.hpp`):
  - Fixed-size, cache-aligned (`kCacheLine=64`) block allocator with intrusive
    free-list. `Allocate`/`Deallocate` are O(1), `noexcept`, and touch no
    global allocator after construction. Slot size rounded up to a full cache
    line so distinct slots never share one.
  - 11 GoogleTests (`cpp/tests/slab_allocator_test.cpp`) pass under `ctest`.
    Coverage includes: per-slot 64-byte alignment across a fully drained pool,
    no-hot-path-heap-traffic (via intercepted aligned `new[]`/`delete[]`),
    construct/destruct balance across 128 cycles (leak prevention), O(1)
    scaling assertion across a 64× capacity range, exhaustion → `nullptr`,
    LIFO reuse, cross-pool `Owns` rejection, zero-capacity edge case.
- **SPSC ring** (`cpp/core/spsc_ring.hpp`):
  - Lock-free, bounded, drop-on-full ring bridging the internal (hot) clock
    to the external (relay) clock per `docs/architecture.md` §2. Power-of-two
    capacity, bitmask modulo, `std::atomic<size_t>` head/tail with strict
    acquire/release pairing; each hot atomic (`write_idx_`, `read_idx_`,
    `dropped_messages_`) is `alignas(64)` so the producer/consumer never
    MESI-thrash a shared line.
  - `TryPush` never blocks: on full, the write is discarded and
    `dropped_messages_` ticks up — telemetry loss is acceptable, hot-path
    jitter is not. `write_idx_` is not advanced on drop, so surviving
    elements retain strict FIFO order (drops punch holes in the observer's
    view, never in the ordering of what is delivered).
  - Compile-time guards: `T` must be trivially copyable & destructible;
    `std::atomic<size_t>` / `std::atomic<uint64_t>` must be always lock-free.
  - 14 GoogleTests (`cpp/tests/spsc_ring_test.cpp`) pass under `ctest`.
    Coverage: lock-free traits, per-atomic 64-byte line separation,
    whole-struct cache alignment, empty pop, single push/pop, order
    preservation across wraparound (32 rounds × capacity-8), exact capacity
    occupancy, drop counter exact under 10 000-attempt overflow, producer
    never stalls (100 000 back-to-back drops < 1 s), drops do not corrupt
    the FIFO of survivors, interleaved push/pop counter monotonicity, and
    two concurrent producer/consumer tests — a slow consumer that forces
    saturation (`produced == received + dropped`, strictly monotone
    delivery) and a retrying producer that must deliver every value in
    issue order.

**Pending:**
- `cpp/core/order_book.{hpp,cpp}` — intrusive `LevelFIFO`, O(1) cancel.
- Benchmark harness (Google Benchmark, HdrHistogram) + `latency_report.md`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with the benchmark-regression gate.

**Bugs/Issues:** None.

**Next Tasks:**
1. Wire the slab into the `LevelFIFO` order book (intrusive nodes, O(1)
   cancel), and route order-book state changes through the SPSC ring to
   the relay side.
2. Stand up the Google Benchmark harness so P1's gate — p50/p99/p99.9
   histogram + `perf` counters — has somewhere to publish.
3. Add the CI workflow with the benchmark-regression gate.
